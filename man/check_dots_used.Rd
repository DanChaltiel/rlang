\title{Check that all dots have been used}
\usage{
check_dots_used(env = caller_env(), call = caller_env(), action = abort)
}
\arguments{
\item{env}{Environment in which to look for \code{...} and to set up handler.}

\item{call}{An expression (as returned by e.g.
\code{sys.call()}) representing the context in which the error
occurred. If non-null, the call is stripped of its arguments to
keep it simple.

Can also be an execution environment of a currently running
function (as returned by e.g. \code{parent.frame()}). The
corresponding call is then retrieved.

See also \code{\link[=local_error_call]{local_error_call()}}.}

\item{action}{The action to take when the dots have not been used. One of
\code{\link[=abort]{abort()}}, \code{\link[=warn]{warn()}}, \code{\link[=inform]{inform()}} or \code{\link[=signal]{signal()}}.}
}
\description{
Automatically sets exit handler to run when function terminates, checking
that all elements of \code{...} have been evaluated. If you use \code{\link[=on.exit]{on.exit()}}
elsewhere in your function, make sure to use \code{add = TRUE} so that you
don't override the handler set up by \code{check_dots_used()}.
